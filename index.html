        <h5>HTML</h5>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
          content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
          such as JavaScript.

          Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying
          the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup
          language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
          World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        <h5>JavaScript</h5>
        <p>
          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
          core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites
          use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers

        <h5>Python</h5>
        <p>
          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
          design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
          significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and
          garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
          including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.
